DCMBot
======

Programmed in C, this is a bot I made after a fellow Atlanta Braves fan who used odd phrasing

I have also added two javascript versions of DCMBot. I took advantage of the Object data structure to make 
an easy way to check if a player had been put in the lineup. THE HTML version is something I am working to get work in
Google sites. Otherwise it should run if ran as a standalone HTML file.
